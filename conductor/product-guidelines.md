# Product Guidelines

## Prose and Communication Style
- **Tone:** Precise, concise, and professional. Mirroring the "Linear style"—minimalist, efficient, and high-quality.
- **Audience:** Primarily developers and technical stakeholders.
- **Clarity:** Avoid jargon unless it's standard industry terminology (e.g., GraphQL, SDK, CI/CD).
- **Instructional Style:** Use active voice and imperative mood for documentation (e.g., "Run this command" instead of "This command should be run").

## Brand and Messaging
- **Core Value Proposition:** Efficiency, type-safety, and reliability. We are the bridge between developer intent and the Linear platform.
- **Consistency:** Use "Linear API" or "Linear SDK" consistently. Ensure terminology aligns with the main [Linear documentation](https://developers.linear.app).
- **Quality:** Every message, error, and piece of documentation should feel "built by Linear"—polished and thoughtful.

## Visual Identity (Documentation and Assets)
- **Aesthetic:** Clean, minimalist, and high-contrast. Follow the visual language of Linear (dark mode preference, subtle gradients, focus on typography).
- **Diagrams:** Use professional, clear diagrams for architectural explanations.
- **Logos:** Use official Linear logos and icons exclusively.

## Error Handling and Feedback
- **Actionability:** Error messages should clearly explain *what* went wrong and *how* to fix it.
- **Formatting:** Code blocks and technical terms should be formatted consistently in monospaced font.
